this repository includes concepts of thresholding and filters in opencv in oython.
description of the files:
1. thresholding.py : this contains the various methods of thresholding available in opencv library and its implementation using python. Some of the thresholding methods are binary thresholding, to - zero thresholding etc. further implementation of OSTU's is also described.
2. filters.py: implementation of denoising filters like gaussian filter, median filter and blur filters are shown in this piece of code. further Canny edge detection is also done using the opencv library.
3. masking.py : this code includes the hsv thresholding implementation. from finding the lower and the upper bounds to making the mask.
