this repository includes concepts of thresholding and filters in opencv in oython.
description of the files:
1. thresholding.py : this contains the various methods of thresholding available in opencv library and its implementation using python. Some of the thresholding methods are binary thresholding, to - zero thresholding etc. further implementation of OSTU's is also described.
2. filters.py: implementation of denoising filters like gaussian filter, median filter and blur filters are shown in this piece of code. further Canny edge detection is also done using the opencv library.
3. masking.py : this code includes the hsv thresholding implementation. from finding the lower and the upper bounds to making the mask.
4. motion.py: normal motion detection using mediapipe. Simply some fun hobby coding!
## movement detection and localisation using heatmap

 4.heatmap.py: the script on running produces heatmap over the actual image covering those regions where any movement is observed. to create the heatmap feature map of intermediate layer in resnet50 architecture is taken.
